# Ethics Statement
## Scope of use

This model was trained on data provided from the following [source](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks). This dataset is comprised of various different scenes of artificially generated roads. These are from the perspective of a 'car'. Given this, this model should be used in the context of landscapes. It is not trained to identify people or animals and as such should not be used in contexts where this might be critical. 

## Potential Bias

The dataset is artificially generated and as such is biased towards typical lighting scenarios, american style buildings and landscapes. This may impact application in diverse lighting conditions or different geographies.

## Diffusion model concerns

Protections for misuse of the diffusion model are provided by the model creators stabilityAI. NSFW detection and similar parameters.
